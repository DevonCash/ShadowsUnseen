# Shadows Unseen
An occult detective game

## Description
Shadows Unseen is a game about a detective in an urban-fantasy setting resembling the United States just before the Great Depression. The player will investigate crimes and solve mysteries as a private eye, and will have to deal with the supernatural as well as the mundane.

## Gameplay
- String board: A board of strings and pins that the player can use to connect clues and suspects.
- Dialogue: A dialogue system that allows the player to ask questions and make accusations.
- Inventory: A collection of items that the player can use to solve puzzles.
- Map: A map of the city that the player can use to travel to different locations.
- Notebook: A notebook that the player can use to keep track of their thoughts and observations.

## Cases
Rather than working a single case at a time, the player will be able to work on multiple cases simultaneously. This will allow the player to switch between cases if they get stuck on one, and will allow the player to make connections between cases.
This will also allow the player to work on cases that are not directly related to the main plot, which will allow the player to explore the world and learn more about the setting.
Certain events in cases need to be coordinated with the main timeline, so the player will not be able to work on cases indefinitely.
