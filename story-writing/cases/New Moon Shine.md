# New Moon's Shine

In a city already plagued by crime, a bootlegging operation is utilizing supernatural assistance to evade law enforcement. Dismantle the operation while dealing with paranormal obstacles.

Not personally offended by the bootlegging, but the fact that they're using magic to do it is a problem.

The gang in charge of moving the booze is using frequent contact with a demon to perform light mind control on investigators and law enforcement. The demon is also owed a favor by a law enforcement officer, who is using his influence to keep the operation running smoothly.
